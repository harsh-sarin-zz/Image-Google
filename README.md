IMAGE GOOGLE:

DESCRIPTION:
A tool to simplify the process of image search on PCs.
Use Case: You went on a vacation, clicked 200 pictures, and uploaded them on your Desktop/PC. The photos have names like ‘DSC2014093.jpg’, and you want to find a photograph of an elephant ride you took. You will have to probably browse through each image until you find the one you were looking for. Image Google helps simplify this process. All you have to do is enter a query like “Elephant”, and the tool will return all images that have elephants in them, among the 200 images in your database.
In its current form, the user must provide an image of an elephant as input, and the tool will return all images that have elephants on them.
